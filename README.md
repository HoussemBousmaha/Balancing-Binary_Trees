# Binary_Trees_Special_Transformations

* In This Repository, We Implement The Binary Tree Data Structure.
* After That We Perform Some Very Special Transformations On The Tree Using Some Nice Algorithms

## Binary Tree Structure

* the structure of our tree is special
* because every node contains two values:
    1- the data value
    2- the color value (white or black)

* there is only two colors so the color value is a boolean
    1- true if the color is black
    2- false if it is white

* the root is a special node, because it have a value that is greater than all values in the tree and its color is black



#### after the construction of the tree it should look like this
